# CMD_Grapher
A class for displaying graphs of math functions to the command prompt (or terminal).

Test.java demos the grapher, graphing y=sin(2x) from -pi to +pi.

MathFunctions.java contains the MathFunction interface and some fun math functions to try in the grapher.

CmgGraph.java is the class which has a static method "graph" to graph to the command prompt.



This is just a fun little math/coding thing I made a few months ago to have some fun in Java.
